# Project's Landing Page

This is a simple responsive landing page built using Bootstrap to display projects I built during the Bloc.io coding bootcamp. This site will have a thumbnail of each project with a short description and you will be able to click through to each project and demo it. Projects will be individual sub domains on bloc-austin.xyz
